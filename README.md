# Hey! I'm Bee, B-Dubs, Brandon  
Depends on who you ask, I guess.

- CS undergrad at Arizona State University, minoring in Physics  
- Interested in quantum computing, AI/ML or whatever cool topic I see online that week  
- Usually coding in Python or C++, but I love throwing myself into the unknown  

## Current Projects  
- **Blackjack Trainer Web App** — exploring probability/statistics through gameplay *(Python + FastAPI, JS, HTML/CSS)*  
- **Quantum Computing Toy Projects** — experimenting with Qiskit and core concepts  *(Python + Qiskit)*

## Repo Showcase  
- [Blackjack CLI Game](https://github.com/Washington-Dev983/BlackJack-Trainer) — baseline for full web app  

## Say Hi  
I'm not very talkative, but I really enjoy listening. Feel free to reach out!
